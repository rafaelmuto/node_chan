# ᶘ ᵒᴥᵒᶅ node_chan

a node.js/express/mongoDB powered image board ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ

---

node_chan is a image BBS inspired by many futaba clones.
It runs in node.js/express and uses a mongoDB database.

## to do:

in no particular order...

- thread model (has many posts)
- implement config 'working on it!'
- display grid in post list 'kinda working, but not there yet...'
- color themes
- delete and edit posts with delete code
- respond post; nested in the orginial post
- tripcode signing
- better logging... for future security...

## future:

- REST api for quoting posts
- update to a MERN stack...?
- maybe vue...
